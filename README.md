Health mate is a Machine Learning web app created using flask and deployed using Heroku. In a densely populated country like India, there is a disparity between the number of patients to the number of specialists.

Health mate attempts to bride this gap and make health care more accessible and affordable, and increase the reach of health care systems. It enables the early detection of symptoms and diseases, thereby increasing chances of survival. It also aids in the clinical decision making process and helps improve clinical outcomes. It focuses on making health care more consumer centric.
